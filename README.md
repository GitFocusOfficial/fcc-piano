# Learn Responsive Web Design by Building a Piano

Responsive Design tells your webpage how it should look on different-sized screens.

In this course, you'll use CSS and Responsive Design to code a piano. You'll also learn more about media queries and pseudo selectors.

## Step 1

Begin with the basic HTML structure. Add a `DOCTYPE` declaration and `html`, `head`, `body`, and `title` elements.

Set the language of this page to English. Set the `title` to `Piano`.

## Step 2

Add two `meta` tags, one to optimize your page for mobile devices, and one to specify an accepted `charset` for the page.

## Step 3

Time to start working on the piano. Create a `div` element within your `body` element with the `id` set to `piano`.

## Step 4

Nest a second `div` within your existing div, and set the `class` to be `keys`.

## Step 5

Within your `.keys` element, add seven `div` elements. Give them all the class `key`.
